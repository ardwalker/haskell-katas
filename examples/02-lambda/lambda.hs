-- Lambdas are basically anonymous functions that are used because we need 
-- some functions only once. Normally, we make a lambda with the sole purpose 
-- of passing it to a higher-order function.


-- An anonymous function is a function without a name. It is a Lambda
-- abstraction and might look like this: \x -> x + 1. (That backslash is 
-- Haskell's way of expressing a Î» and is supposed to look like a Lambda.)


-- Sometimes it is more convenient to use a lambda expression rather than
-- giving a function a name. This is often the case when using map and foldl
-- / foldr. So to add one to each element of a list, without anonymous 
-- functions
addOneList lst = map addOne' lst 
  where addOne' x = x + 1



-- But here's another way, where we pass the anonymous function into map
-- rather than any named function.
addOneList' lst = map (\x -> x + 1) lst
